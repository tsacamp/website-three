<p> Today we went to walk around the Smithsonian building. We saw an exhibt all about dinosaurs. We saw a room where you could watch the people who work at the smothsonian clean and study the fossils. We also saw some bones of dinosaurs, and a giant squid that was very large and very scary. The hall also showed how the dinosaurs lived and what they were like. One of the rooms showed how one of the animals back then walked and how its shoulders moved. The same hall also showed how the dinosaurs become fossils. It depends on the type of enviorment. Some animals were also more likely to decompose than to fossilize. <p>

 <p style= "font-size:100%;font-family: arial; text-align: center">We also saw how humans had evolved and how we operate. It showed what we were doing to the earth, and how we can improve the world, and it showed how our favorite things such as art and technology play a parrt in our world and how they can also help save our world.  </p>

<h3 style="font-stize: 300%;font_family:elephant:text-align: center"> Deep time</h3
<p style= "font-size:200%;font-family: arial; text-align: center"> One of my favorite parts of the dino hall was the deep time exhibt. It showed dinos from the mesozoic era. They showed the  torosaurus, the t-rex, the triceratops, and the ceratasaurus. Deep time also didnt have just dinosaurs, they also had animals from the ice age such as the wolly mamoth skeleton, which is placed at the enterance of the deep time exhibit.    </p>

<h4 style="font-size: 300%;font_family:elephant:text-align: center"> Fossils </h4>

 <p style= "font-size:100%;font-family: arial; text-align: center"> My all time favorite part of the hall was definitely the fossils. I loved watching the workers clean the fossils, and look at them under the microscope. Right next to the big window was an interactive game where you had to be a old animal and you had to choos ewhere you were going to live and depending on what animal you choose and what climate you choose to live in, you would either fossilize, decompose, or you weould get eaten, if you were a triceratops near a water climate, you might decompose.   </p>

<h5 style="font-size:300%;font-family: arial; text-align:left"> Skeletons </h5>

<p style="font-size:100%; font-family: arial; text align:left"> Something that I found intresting was the very large dinosaur skeletons all throughout the hall. My favorite, the diplodocus was one of the largest, and the most heavy. Its tail bone alone weighs about 70 pounds, 80 bones, and it takes about 40 minutes to assmble just the tailbone.  </p>
